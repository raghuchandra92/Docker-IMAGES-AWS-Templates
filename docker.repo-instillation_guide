#This file is instillation guide for docker[CE/EE] for begginers, Welcome !!
#So, before going to instillation please refer https://success.docker.com/article/Compatibility_Matrix for heads-up
#Docker instillation steps - As of now am using CentOS-7.x , same for RedHat 7.x
#=========================================================================================================#
#Step-1:First install docker-ce,i installed using the procedure show below
#=========================================================================================================#
#First am installing device mapper to give me the ability to map different types of storage sub systems for my container, note
#below command work only for centos/redhat. 
yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
#Now i will cofigure my official docker repository to pull stable images, am using this repo as a production repo, depending on your 
#software flavour/version you can modify the below https link accrodingly. Now install docker-ce , which docker with docker swarm which
# isn't available in previous editions. then restart your docker service as show below.
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum update
yum install docker-ce
systemctl enbale docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
#Now once installation is done, one root can user docker. if you want to give axis to docker for a normal system user you can do so
#by adding that person in docker.sock file, below are the commands to that, if you are root then skip below steps 
cd /var/run
ls -l # now you see docker.sock file
usermod -aG docker $username
#Now logout of the system and login back , now as a normal user you will have access to docker

#=========================================================================================================#
#Step-2:Now i will make sure i use device mapper for my storage type 
#=========================================================================================================#
#you have two kinds of storage, a device mapper and a block storage device which is managed by docker. to know about your default storage type use 
docker info | grep Storage 
#by default you see the type as overlay, so to change it into device mapper , with out screwing up your configuration , create
#a file in /etc/docker as show below
cd /etc/docker
vim deamon.json #In that file add below code 
{
  "storage-driver":"devicemapper"   #you can add the storage type use use, also refer device mapper documentation for more info 
}
systemctl stop docker
systemctl start docker
docker info | grep Storage #Now you should see device mapper

#=========================================================================================================================#
#Step-3: vim deamon.json
#=========================================================================================================================#
#
#=========================================================================================================================#
#Step-3:Now rum $sudo yum install docker-engine.
#=========================================================================================================================#
#Instead of installing the plain docker, try to install the docker-engine which includes docker and docker engine and
#associated  SELinux package, so your Docker server  and Docker client runs smoothly.
#
#Once you are done with instillation, now use $sudo service docker start
#Once you start docker check the status using $sudo service docker status (now you see docker running with a pid)
#
#=========================================================================================================================#
#Step-4:By this time you are almost done, now you use $sudo docker images, command to see images in your docker(system)
#=========================================================================================================================#
#By default docker creates a directory in /var/run with the name, docker.sock, which is a docker group and if you are not a 
#member in this group or if you are not root, then you will not have access to Docker Deamon, that a security parameter
#if you are not a member dont worry just add your self using the command 
#$sudo usermod -G docker, now exit and re-login for the effects to take place
#
#=========================================================================================================================#
#Step-5:In this final step you test weather your docker app is pulling image properly from repo and running a container 
#=========================================================================================================================#
#Now run the command $docker run hello-world, now you can see the output and it says your docker runs sucessfully
